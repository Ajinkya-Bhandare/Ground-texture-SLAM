# Ground Texture SLAM

A SLAM system that only uses the ground beneath the robot. For more details about how it works, see
the paper "Monocular Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using Ground Textures"

## Distribution Statement ##
Distribution Statement A - Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited, as submitted
under NAVAIR Public Release Authorization 2022-0586.

## Installation ##
This system is targeted towards Ubuntu 20.04, OpenCV version 4.2.0, and GTSAM version 4.1.1. It is
highly likely that other versions would work, but they have not been tested. There are two ways to
use this library: from a Docker image or build from source manually.

### Docker ###
There is a Docker file that you can build that will provide everything. From the project workspace,
just run:
```bash
docker build --build-arg GTSAM_VERSION=4.1.1 --build-arg OPENCV_VERSION=4.2.0 --build-arg OS=ubuntu:20.04 --target deploy --tag ground_texture_slam:deploy -f .\.devcontainer\Dockerfile .
```
Again, you can customize the arguments if you wish, but this is untested. This library installs the
C++ and Python libraries in the relevant directories so they are available system wide.

### From Source ###
If you want to build this library manually, make sure GTSAM and OpenCV are both installed. They can
be installed from source or via `apt-get`. Then, from the root of this project, run:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target install
```
The last command installs both libraries so they are available system wide. You will need sudo
rights for this last command.

## How to Use ##
For an example use, see the files `src/simple_example.cpp` and `src/simple_example.py`. These
illustrate basic usage. Note that the estimated poses will not necessarily be correct, as there are
a lot of random values generated. They are only to illustrate the API.

## Full Documentation ##
Full documentation can be generated by running this command from the project root:
```bash
doxygen Doxyfile
```
Then, open `docs/html/index.html` in the browser to view the documentation.
